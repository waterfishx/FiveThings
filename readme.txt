In this Android Application, I build up a program to introduce some nice but not so popular cities in Europe. I would like to do this because I have been to those places, whey are very nice but not a lot of people know them, so I want to share these cities to others. In this app, I Introduced 5 cities: Vilnius, Tallinn, Sofia, Reykyavik and Banska Bystrica, and link up those pages by Next" and "Previous" buttons. In each page, I provided a short introduction for each city, and there is a button, called "location", when the users press this button, it will redirect the user's phone to browse Google Map, which shows that particular city's location. The background of each page was a photo of those cities, which were taken by me. The introdution words can be selected so that the users can highlight the words and copy them, in order to have further usage.
